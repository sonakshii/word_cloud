# word_cloud
Created a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, 
count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate 
the image from the dictionary. For the input text of your script, you will need to provide a file that contains text only and save it by name "final.txt". 
For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website or book you like.
